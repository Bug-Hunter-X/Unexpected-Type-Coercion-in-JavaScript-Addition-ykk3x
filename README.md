This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked issue in JavaScript: type coercion during arithmetic operations.  The `bug.js` file shows how adding a number and a string results in unexpected string concatenation.  The solution in `bugSolution.js` highlights how to avoid this by explicitly type-checking or converting inputs before performing the addition operation. This is a crucial concept for any JavaScript developer to understand and prevent subtle errors in their applications.
